**Getting Started**

Now it's time for you to get started. It's easy. First, change directory into your
new project's folder. You can use cd aurelia-app to get there. Once in your project folder, simply run your new
app with au run. Your app will run fully bundled. If you would like to have it auto-refresh whenever you make
changes to your HTML, JavaScript or CSS, simply use the --watch flag If you want to build your app for production, run
au build --env prod. That's just about all there is to it. If you need help, simply run au
help.
